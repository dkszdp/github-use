### What is GitHub?
- So, ***GitHub*** is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.  
Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for developers and teams to use **Git** for **version control** and collaboration.  

- ***Git***: is an open source distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.
- ***Version control*** helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. It allows developers to work safely through branching and merging. With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project. Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code back into the main source code to make it official. All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.
